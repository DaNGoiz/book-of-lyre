I slumber most of the time.
B
Whoa! Do you know Sleeping Beauty?
A
...
B
Have you seen my bunny Roloi? It’s kind of chubby. Maybe you happened to see a fur-ball before?
C
Looks like you don’t know about this. I’ll find Roloi somewhere else anyway.
A
O, please wait!
You are the chosen one destined to save our nation.
B
Save a nation? Sounds cool.
But I have to find my bunny, she must have been starving.
A

B
I knew Roloi is a bunny of great dreams.
A
So maybe we can talk.
B
Well, I’m always glad to talk to a statue.
A
So where shall we start?
C
I should have brought some cookies for the story.
A
Oh, yes, everyone loves a nice cookie, but let’s just cut to the chase.
B
Yes, of course.
